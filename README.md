# Data Collection Details  
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinbonnie/airport-information).  


## Dataset Description  
This dataset contains the list of all airport codes, the attributes are identified in data package description. Some of the columns contain attributes identifying airport locations, other codes (IATA, local if exist) that are relevant to identification of an airport.

### Airport 
| Feature Name      | Description  |
|------------------|-------------|
| **ID**    | Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the airport. This will stay persistent, even if the airport code changes.  |
| **Ident**   | The text identifier used in the OurAirports URL. This will be the ICAO code if available. Otherwise, it will be a local airport code (if no conflict), or if nothing else is available, an internally-generated code starting with the ISO2 country code, followed by a dash and a four-digit number. |
| **Type**      | The type of the airport. Allowed values are "closed_airport", "heliport", "large_airport", "medium_airport", "seaplane_base", and "small_airport". See the map legend for a definition of each type.  |
| **Name**    | The official airport name, including "Airport", "Airstrip", etc.  |
| **Latitude deg**  | The airport latitude in decimal degrees (positive for north).  |
| **Longitude deg**    | The airport longitude in decimal degrees (positive for east).  |
| **Elevation ft**       | The airport elevation MSL in feet (not metres).  |
| **Continent**          | The code for the continent where the airport is (primarily) located. Allowed values are "AF" (Africa), "AN" (Antarctica), "AS" (Asia), "EU" (Europe), "NA" (North America), "OC" (Oceania), or "SA" (South America).  |
| **iso_country**       | The two-character ISO 3166:1-alpha2 code for the country where the airport is (primarily) located. A handful of unofficial, non-ISO codes are also in use, such as "XK" for Kosovo. Points to the code column in countries.csv.  |
| **iso_region**      | An alphanumeric code for the high-level administrative subdivision of a country where the airport is primarily located (e.g. province, governorate), prefixed by the ISO2 country code and a hyphen. OurAirports uses ISO 3166:2 codes whenever possible, preferring higher administrative levels, but also includes some custom codes. See the documentation for regions.csv.  |
| **municipality** | The primary municipality that the airport serves (when available). Note that this is not necessarily the municipality where the airport is physically located.  |
| **Scheduled Service**    | "yes" if the airport currently has scheduled airline service; "no" otherwise.  |
| **GPS code** | The code that an aviation GPS database (such as Jeppesen's or Garmin's) would normally use for the airport. This will always be the ICAO code if one exists. Note that, unlike the ident column, this is not guaranteed to be globally unique.  |
| **local_code** | The local country code for the airport, if different from the gps_code and iata_code fields (used mainly for US airports).  |

### Frequency
| Feature Name      | Description  |
|------------------|-------------|
| **ID**    | Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the frequency. This will stay persistent, even if the radio frequency or description changes.  |
| **Airport ref**   |  Internal integer foreign key matching the id column for the associated airport in airports.csv. (airport_ident is a better alternative.) |
| **Airport ident**      | Externally-visible string foreign key matching the ident column for the associated airport in airports.csv.  |
| **Type**    | A code for the frequency type. This isn't (currently) a controlled vocabulary, but probably will be soon. Some common values are "TWR" (tower), "ATF" or "CTAF" (common traffic frequency), "GND" (ground control), "RMP" (ramp control), "ATIS" (automated weather), "RCO" (remote radio outlet), "ARR" (arrivals), "DEP" (departures), "UNICOM" (monitored ground station), and "RDO" (a flight-service station).  |
| **Description**  | A description of the frequency, typically the way a pilot would open a call on it.  |
| **Frequency mhz**    | Radio voice frequency in megahertz. Note that the same frequency may appear multiple times for an airport, serving different functions.  |


## Usage  
This dataset is valuable for:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding airports and their radio frquencies.  
- **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models to **predict airport types** or **predict radio frquency used by an airport** based on the provided features.  

By leveraging this dataset, financial institutions can gain **data-driven insights** to enhance customer retention strategies and optimize business decisions.
